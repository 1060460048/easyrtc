# easyRTC API to/from Server Messages

easyRTC socket messages are sent via socket.io using three custom emit types:

 - **easyrtcAuth** - Initial negotiation and authentication
 - **easyrtcCmd** - All standard easyRTC communications including WebRTC messages
 - **easyrtcMsg** - Custom application specific messages 


----------


# easyrtcAuth

"easyrtcAuth" is the socket.io emit type which easyRTC expects to initialize (or re-initialize) a connection. No other messages are handled by easyRTC until a connection is authenticated.
