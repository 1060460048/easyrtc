    <p>
    The application demonstrates text messaging using the easyRTC.sendData method.
    It should connect to the server upon start up, and display buttons for the other
    peers running the same application.
    To use it, enter a message into the text box on the left side of the page.
    Then press one of the buttons for another peer to send the message to that peer.
    The message should appear on the text box to the right on both this page, and that of the peer.
    </p>
